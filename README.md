This is a repository that contains a project summary of helping develop ARCHIMEDES(ARCHetype for IMprovED knowledgE Search) as a 2023 summer intern at Euler Science LLC. 

## **Project Objectives:**
The primary objective of ARCHIMEDES is to enhance the efficiency and intuitiveness of exploration and discovery in fields heavily reliant on research. The project seeks to address the limitations of traditional search engines, particularly in scientific and research contexts.

The goal of ARCHIMEDES is to recontextualize the problem domain of search engines, moving away from rank-based methods towards interactive graphical search. By doing so, the project aims to provide a more effective tool for scientists, researchers, graduate students, and patent lawyers to quickly discover and assess relevant research literature and prior art.

## **Business Perspective:**
From a business perspective, ARCHIMEDES aims to reduce research timelines and budgets. By offering a more efficient and intuitive search engine, the project seeks to enable more impactful research.
ARCHIMEDES provides users with the ability to quickly discover and assess relevant research literature and prior art. The shift from rank-based methods to interactive graphical search is intended to offer a valuable tool for scientists and researchers, ultimately reducing the time and costs associated with research endeavors.

## **Why It's Important:**
ARCHIMEDES is important because it addresses the inadequacies of traditional search engines in fields where exploration and discovery play a crucial role, such as research. By making the search process more efficient and intuitive, the project contributes to the advancement of technology by facilitating quicker access to pertinent information, thus accelerating the pace of impactful research.

## Responsible tasks
I worked on one major project with two components. 

1. I implemented a processing pipeline that extracted and converted patent information for comparison via semantic similarity. 
Semantic similarity was achieved through the development of tools and processing scripts that created document embeddings using  encoders from Large Language Models. 
The corresponding embeddings were then clustered and evaluated using a distance metric. 

2. I also prototyped a quality  control pipeline where the ranking of documents by semantic similarity was evaluated and compared.
