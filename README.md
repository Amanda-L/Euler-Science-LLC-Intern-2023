# Responsible tasks

I worked on one major project with two components. 

For the first, I implemented a processing pipeline that extracted and converted patent information for comparison via semantic similarity. 
Semantic similarity was achieved through the development of tools and processing scripts that created document embeddings using  encoders from Large Language Models. 
The corresponding embeddings were then clustered and evaluated using a distance metric. 

For the second, I also prototyped a quality  control pipeline where the ranking of documents by semantic similarity was evaluated and compared.
